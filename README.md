  Log into your AWS Educate account. The "My Classrooms" tab on the top banner in the interface directs to the complete list of classrooms supported on the account. From there,   select the desired classroom by clicking the blue "Go to classroom" button. The third party, Vocareum, will launch, allowing the management of the classroom. To launch an      instance, select "AWS console". TO launch the instance, select EC2 from the list of services AWS provides.

  Instruction
  Launching an instance supported by EC2 is a seven step process. Follow the following instructions to ensure the instance has the maximum security and memory for the free teir   offered by AWS. 

  First, select an Ubunto server as the desired Amazon Machine Image (AMI). 20.4 was selected in this demonstration, although any can be selcted, given Ubunto is the AMI. 

  The next tab requests an instance type to be selected. The "general purpose" option will be preselected and be elgible for AWS's free tier. Click "Next: Configure Image" to   continue.
 
  Immediately continue to "Next: Add Storage".
